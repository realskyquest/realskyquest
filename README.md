# Hello there, I'm realSkyQuest

I have been programming for around 5 years, and primarily work on front-end web development.	
With some experience in back-end web development.

I first started programming in 2019, using Roblox (Lua) to create mini-games. After that, I started using Python to do niche tasks and QB64 (basic) to play around with 2D graphics.	

Eventually, I started exploring other languages such as C, C++, C#, Godot (GDscript), Rust, and VBasic. Soon, I went into web development with the support of my friends and other developers who helped me on various issues and tasks.
